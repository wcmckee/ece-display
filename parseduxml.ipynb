      "<p>Ten teaching spaces, old and no longer fit for purpose, were demolished to make way for the new classrooms. These have been built to innovative learning environment standards.</p>\n",

      "<p>The contrast between the new and old buildings is stark, according to Principal Carolyn Marino. She says there are purpose built kitchen areas for every three teachers, large art and science areas, and many other useful facilities that will create a great environment for teaching and learning.</p>\n",

      "<p>To meet the needs of the way students learn, the Ministry is rolling out flexible learning spaces as schools are renovated or rebuilt.</p>\n",
      "<p>Ms Shannon said building projects start with schools figuring out how they intend future teaching and learning to take place.  This is translated into the required physical spaces, with designs and plans independently reviewed at different stages of a development.</p>\n",
      "<p>Some Christchurch schools are also making small changes to existing buildings such as opening walls between classrooms, so schools can experiment with how spaces will work best for them before they are replaced.</p>\n",
      "<p>Ms Shannon told the conference New Zealand is well ahead of the international norm regarding teaching with technology, with 55% of teachers using computer technology compared with 38% internationally. </p>\n",
      "<p>It also has the third highest ratio of computers for educational purposes to student ratio (behind Australia and Austria) of 65 surveyed countries. </p>\n",
      "<p>By the end of 2015 more than $280 million will have been spent on completing technology network upgrades in all 2,451 New Zealand state and state integrated schools and kura, with $136 million invested since 2013.</p>\n",
      "<p>New Zealand is also reinventing the prefabs of old into high quality relocatable buildings which provide flexible learning spaces. Nine modules can be combined in dozens of different ways, even stacked as two-storey buildings, to meet a wide range of educational needs.</p>\n",
      "<p>Their advantages include:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>less management effort by school staff and boards</li>\n",
      "<li>quick installations and removal, involving less disruption</li>\n",
      "<li>greater versatility in how these spaces are used and</li>\n",
      "<li>the ability to be relocated and reconfigured multiple times.</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p>Ms Shannon also showed a video demonstrating some of the innovative school environments being rolled out across the country: <a href=\"file://hocfs02/Property/EIS%20Image%20Library/VIDEOS/NZ%20Form%20Follows%20Learning.mp4\">Form Follows Learning</a>.

Is more time spent with some parents than others? Is that OK? Jilly reports that where centres had reviewed their procedures and practices honestly, some extraordinary gains could be made in attendance and relationships with families.</p>\n",

      "<p>Conversation centered on what is expected of a child when they start school, initial assessments, and National Standards requirements. Services were able to share their children’s learning journeys with the school teachers and with each other. The question at the forefront was not “Is the child ready for school?” but rather “Is the school ready for the child?”</p>\n",
      "<p>The group viewed the Te Mata School transition class and the junior school. There was time for questions to gain a better understanding of Te Mata School, its tamariki, and its philosophy.</p>\n",
      "<p>Feedback has been positive, with some reporting it was the first time they had met with the different ECE services in their community.

      "<li>Hold daily conversations and have a key teacher approach, which supports good relationships with whānau.</li>\n",
      "<li>An open door policy allows whānau to spend as much time as they like with their babies. </li>\n",
      "<li>Provide a breastfeeding chair and space to breastfeed in private. Hastings Barnardos Kidstart also provides food and drink. </li>\n",
      "<li>Consider offering free parent-infant classes covering a range of topics such as attachment, free movement, care moments, and respect. </li>\n",

      "<h3>Cook Islands Playgroup celebrates Language Week in Naenae</h3>\n",
      "<p><em>“Kia tupu, kia ruperupe. Grow and be beautiful.”</em></p>\n",
      "<p>This is the vision of Avaiki Nui Playgroup. On 5 August, to help promote early learning, Avaiki Nui Playgroup hosted a play day at Naenae Kindergarten to celebrate Cook Islands Language Week. The playgroup invited families to attend through the Lower Hutt Early Learning Community Action Group (CAG).</p>\n",
      "<p>The play day provided rich learning experiences, including <em>Tāmataora: ‘Ìmene e te ‘Ura</em> – song and dance, <em>Ma’ani ‘Apinga Kūki ‘Airani</em> – Cook Islands art, <em>Tutu Akara’anga</em> – describing things, and Kaikai – learning the names of fruit and some common Cook Islands food.</p>\n",
      "<p>Joining in the festivities were their friends from Naenae Kindergarten and Best Start’s Community Kindy Naenae. Others who attended from the CAG were Nākū Ēnei Tamariki and Pacific Health Services Hutt Valley.</p>\n",
      "<p>Before the event, many who attended did not know there was a Cook Islands playgroup in Naenae. Even fewer were aware of the large Cook Islands community in the wider Hutt region. People were able to network at the event, and plans are set to continue promoting Avaiki Nui Playgroup.</p>\n",
      "<p>Another significant outcome has been increased participation from families, seeing three generations attend together. Children at Avaiki Nui are privileged to have their mothers, grandmothers and aunties all attending playgroup. On special occasions like Language Week fathers, grandfathers and uncles often turn up too.</p>\n",
      "<h3>About Cook Islands Language Week 2015</h3>\n",
      "<p>The theme for this year’s language week was <em>‘To tātou reo tūpuna e korona ia no to tātou matakeinganga. Our language is a crowning glory of our community’</em>. It was also an opportunity to acknowledge the Cook Islands’ 50-year anniversary of independence.</p>\n",
      "<h3>About Avaiki Nui Playgroup</h3>\n",
      "<p>The playgroup was established under the umbrella of the Hutt Valley Cook Islands Association in 2014. This was in response to increasing demand from Cook Islands families wanting to access language and cultural learning while improving access to early childhood education (ECE).</p>\n",
      "<p>Avaiki Nui is involved in a Pacific collaboration project that includes other partners: the Poumaama Tongan playgroup, Ko Na Nanu o te Tifa (Tokelau), supported by ACE Aotearoa (Adult and Community Education), the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, Hutt City Kindergarten Association, Naenae Kindergarten and the Ministry of Education’s Lower Hutt office.</p>\n",
      "<p>With generous and kind support, Avaiki Nui operates on Wednesday afternoons at Naenae Kindergarten. It is led by the President of the Hutt Valley Cook Islands Association, Māmā Mii Tupangaia, and Māmā Mii Tangapiri, who has her own grandson attending.</p>\n",
      "<p>The parent coordinator for the Avaiki Nui playgroup is Vivienne Reti, who is of Māori descent. Viv’s son Bronté also attends the playgroup, acknowledging his Cook Islands heritage through his father.</p>\n",
      "<p>Since starting up, the playgroup has welcomed 15 children from families in the Avalon, Naenae, Stokes Valley and Taita suburbs of Lower Hutt.</p>\n",
      "<p>Māmā Mii is positive about the future of the playgroup. “It is still early days for our language and culture strategy. Measuring the impact of the last two years is mainly done through informal measures, such as observation and formative assessment types in daily conversation and feedback about family interaction where this is possible. Our babies are getting older now, moving into kindy and school. Our māmā will keep going to bring the new generation through.”</p>\n",
      "<p>If you are interested in joining the Avaiki Nui Playgroup, go along to Naenae Kindergarten, 19 Seddon Street, Naenae, on Wednesday afternoons.</p>\n",

      "<h3>Celebration of the Early Childhood Pasifika Leadership Programme in the South Island</h3>\n",
      "<p><em>Leaders as leaders, leaders as learners, learners as leaders</em></p>\n",
      "<p>‘Ia su’i tonu le mata o le niu’ means ‘to pierce the right eye of the coconut’. This proverb describes the notion of leadership and going about an undertaking in the right way.</p>\n",
      "<p>The proverb guided the implementation of an exciting Ministry of Education-funded SELO 3 professional development programme that has been in place over the last 18 months.</p>\n",
      "<p>The purpose of the programme was to build culturally intelligent leadership capacity within the early childhood education (ECE) community. Over 40 teachers and leaders from mainstream and Pasifika ECE services in Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill participated in the programme.</p>\n",
      "<p>At the end of May 2015 the programme concluded with a celebration of teachers and leaders sharing their successes and outcomes from their participation. The final celebration was not the end, as these participants have made a commitment to continue networking as a group.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Leading the programme in a Pasifika cultural context</h3>\n",
      "<p>Throughout the programme, leaders from the Pasifika community in Christchurch, who are involved in the education, business, and community sectors, shared the successes and challenges of their leadership journeys. This gave programme participants the opportunity to hear how these stories may influence teachers’ thinking and practice as they work and support Pasifika children and families.</p>\n",
      "<p>Monthly network meetings were full of fun and laughter as teachers developed strong relationships with each other and practised Pasifika languages and songs, which they now use as part of their daily practice with children. These network meetings also strengthened teachers’ understanding about assessment, self-review, transitions and a range of other topics from a Pasifika perspective.</p>\n",
      "<p>As teachers developed their cultural intelligence through participation in the programme they found themselves better positioned to support Pasifika families/fanau in their services.</p>\n",
      "<p>A significant change in one teacher’s practice was her willingness to move beyond the centre gate and visit a family in their home. This enabled the teacher to become familiar with the family’s ways of knowing, being and doing, which she was able to integrate into her practice and resulted in the child’s full participation in ECE.</p>\n",
      "<p>Other teachers made the commitment to attend local Pasifika churches as a way to establish relationships beyond the ECE setting. This gave them the tools to strengthen their spiritual connections with Pasifika families and fanau. The teachers commented on the children’s delight and excitement to see their teachers at church.</p>\n",
      "<p>As participants in the programme increased their knowledge of different Pasifika ways, they developed the confidence to approach Pasifika families. This opened the door for families to contribute and share their cultural knowledge with teachers and children.</p>\n",
      "<p>Underpinned by the ‘Ia su’i tonu le mata o le niu’ metaphor, the final fono was led by church minister Rev Fitifiti Luatua and members from the Samoan matai council in Christchurch. They opened the final fono with the lotu and an ava ceremony. Guests from participating ECE services, the local Ministry of Education office, and the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs attended this special event to support programme participants as they shared and celebrated their Pasifika leadership journey.</p>\n",
      "<p>The two-day fono was filled with inspiring presentations from teachers, children and leaders from the 22 services involved in the programme. There were cultural dances and songs that lifted peoples’ spirits and gave a sense of unity for all involved.</p>\n",

      "<p>Lineti Finau Punivai addresses the fono</p>\n",
      "<h3>Teachers’ voices</h3>\n",
      "<p>The key messages and examples of new learning highlighted the participants’ increasing cultural intelligence, shifts in practice and thinking, which will contribute to improved learning outcomes for Pasifika children, aiga and the community.</p>\n",
      "<p>“The networking has been awesome, the relationships, the connections, the conversations, the challenges and the stories. Again, words cannot convey how incredible this journey has been, leaders as learners, learners as leaders has been evident in action and we are so thankful for this.”</p>\n",
      "<p>“As a guest supporting my teachers I was in awe of the presentations and how far each centre has come on their ongoing journey. I could see the enthusiasm each teacher had for this course.”</p>\n",

      "<p>Initially, the numbers of children and caregivers participating in the programme were low. However, the school office manager, who was the first point of contact for families, was instrumental in promoting the TTS Playgroup. It also helped to have both the Principal and new entrant teacher in attendance at the sessions.</p>\n",
      "<p>Numbers of children attending the TTS Playgroup rose over time from 2 to 13, with most recent new entrants at Hornby School having attended the Playgroup.</p>\n",
      "<p>The Principal and new entrant teacher said, “We have found the programme extremely beneficial to both children and parents, and we see many advantages in the programme. Children are more confident starting school. They slot in from day one and parents are more relaxed and comfortable with the whole transition to school process.”</p>\n",

      "<p>The Early Learning Taskforce initiated an Oral Literacy project in Glen Innes, Auckland in partnership with the Special Education professional practice team and the <a href=\"http://www.manaiakalani.org/\">Manaiakalani Education Trust</a>.</p>\n",
